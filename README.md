# Model Deployment with Flask

This project demonstrates the deployment of machine learning models using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The goal is to showcase a simple yet powerful way to turn your trained models into interactive web applications.

## Overview

In this project, we guide you through the process of deploying a machine learning model (such as a classifier or regressor) as a web application using Flask. Flask provides a convenient and extensible way to expose your models to the world, allowing users to interact with them through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Model Integration:** Learn how to integrate your pre-trained machine learning model into a Flask application.
  
- **API Endpoints:** Create API endpoints to handle model predictions, enabling seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.

- **User Interface:** Design a simple yet effective user interface to capture input data and display model predictions.

- **Scalability:** Understand how Flask enables the deployment of machine learning models that can scale as user demands increase.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. If not, you can download them from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip.pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/), respectively.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/model-deployment-with-flask.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd model-deployment-with-flask
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   This will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/][http://127.0.0.1:5000/] to interact with the deployed machine learning model.
